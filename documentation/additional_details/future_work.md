## Future Development and Enhancements

### Enhancements for Existing Functionalities
To improve the current state of the application, several areas have been identified for further refinement:

* **Advanced Agent Architecture:** The schedule generation and feedback agents could be enhanced by incorporating a broader user context, allowing for more nuanced and personalized responses.
* **Deep AI Personalization:** Transitioning to a more user-oriented AI model that utilizes specific user history and preferences within its context window.
* **Holistic Schedule Generation:** Expanding the types of entities generated by the system to include not only learning tasks but also mandatory breaks, workouts, and leisure activities for a balanced lifestyle.
* **Frontend UX/UI Polish:** Adding interactive elements and animations, such as AI robot characters, to make the interface more engaging and user-friendly.
