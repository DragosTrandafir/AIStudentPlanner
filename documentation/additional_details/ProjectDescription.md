# AI Student Planner

An intelligent, agentic web application designed to automate academic scheduling and project management for students using LLMs and LangChain.

## 1. Project Overview
Our application is a dynamic planning tool that transforms how students manage exam sessions and project deadlines. Unlike static calendars,it uses a multi-miniagent AI system to estimate effort, prioritize tasks, and provide an adaptive schedule that reacts to real-world progress.

## 2. The Problem
Students often struggle with:
* **Time Estimation:** Difficulty in judging how long complex subjects require for mastery.
* **Rigid Scheduling:** Traditional planners break down when a single task is missed.
* **Decision Fatigue:** Spending more time organizing what to study than actually studying.

Out app solves this by automating the decision-making process through AI coordination.

## 3. Core Features & Workflow
* **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Each subject or project is managed by a dedicated **AI Agent** (via LangChain) that analyzes difficulty and deadlines.
* **AI Coordinator:** A master agent synchronizes individual task proposals into a balanced daily/weekly calendar.
* **Dynamic Adaptation:** Users provide feedback (e.g., *"I couldn't finish Task X today"*), and the AI automatically recalibrates the remaining schedule.


## 4. Project Objectives
1.  **Automated Scheduling:** Generate optimal study plans based on subject weight and difficulty.
2.  **Adaptive Logic:** Ensure the plan evolves based on user performance and feedback.
3.  **Centralization:** Merge academic deadlines with personal time.
4.  **Scalability:** Create a modular agent system that can handle any number of subjects.
